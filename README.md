#Save to Mendeley Button

This is a Firefox Add-on that adds a simple button to Save an article to [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com).

This button does the same task as bookmarking the "Save to Mendeley" button listed 
[here](https://www.mendeley.com/import/).

## Why

I wrote this because I was irritated with having to save a JavaScript call to my browser bookmark page. It's a silly 
method and this is more clean and only works when there is an article present.
